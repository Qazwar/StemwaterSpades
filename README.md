Large multiplayer client/server Spades game

Developed from October 2011 - Present

I developed this during my University studies to become a better developer.

The code has been released in hopes of giving others ideas and examples on writing and managing a large codebase for games. It is also a perfect example of how to use my Agui GUI API as I intended to use it.

I hope it will inspire and that others can find it useful!

Only the code for the game, master server, server, and bottester have been provided. The game also needs RakNet and a few other things but my intention is not for people to compile this but rather for it to serve as an example of a large client/server application.

It was a fun project but I no longer have time to continue working on it.

The game is currently available at stemwatergames.com
